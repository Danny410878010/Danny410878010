<h2>ðŸ“Š Data Science & Analysis Projects:</h2>

<h2> Urban Heat Island (UHI) Prediction Using Satellite Imagery (Data Engineering, Deep learning, Machine Learning Algorithm, Visualization) </h2>
<b> This project winning the grand prize in Info-Challenge 2025 in Univeristy of Martland. The project presents the approach to predicting Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity using satellite image data and machine learning. By combining remote sensing spectral bands, engineered features, and advanced modeling techniques, we achieved a highly accurate prediction model with an **RÂ² of 0.94** on testing data. </b>
